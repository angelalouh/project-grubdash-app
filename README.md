# GrubDash App
GrubDash is a fictional company that operates an online food ordering and food delivery platform. The frontend of this application was provided by Thinkful, as the focus of this project was to create the backend of the application.

>You've been hired as a backend developer for a new startup called GrubDash! As another developer works on the design and frontend experience, you have been tasked with setting up an API and building out specific routes so that the frontend developers can demo some initial design ideas for the big bosses.
